        <p>
          According to PEW Research1, 96% of adults between 18-29 occasionally
          consult reviews before making a purchase. But does this mean that
          higher ratings result in more product sales? Specifically, what do
          higher ratings indicate for video game sales? Maybe higher ratings
          lead to more game sales. But could some more obscure games with a
          dedicated group of followers receive higher ratings than popular games
          with significant sales volume? I am also curious whether there has
          been an increase in the production of games in recent years and, if
          so, what affect this increase has on the quality of games based on
          review scores. Is it possible that an increase in the number of games
          results in review scores decreasing with the oversaturation of video
          game releases?

          In this project, I plan to use Metacriticâ€™s user and critic review
          scores to see if there is a correlation between the scores of a game
          and its overall sales. I will be joining the review data with sales
          data obtained from VGChartz.
